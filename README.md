## Assignment 1 

For assignment 1, I have chosen to imitate the style of [Reddit](www.reddit.com).

## Assignment 2 

Hello Cameron! 

I just wanted to write down that we did check that the hosting for the site was working correctly 
in class, and because I'm not on the AWS free tier, we opted to check the 'Can host the site' box. 

I made sure, though, that you can work with 

```
php artisan migrate:fresh --seed 
```

on your local machine. 

Thanks again for all your help and insight. 

All the best, 

Alex

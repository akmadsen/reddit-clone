# CPNT 262 - Journal File


## A Note to Cameron Falkenhagen 

Hi Cameron. This log is going to be pretty verbose, but I'm writing it for me primarily. This is going to be a good 
tool for accountability to make sure that I'm trying (and failing!) at things every night. 

Thank you for this tool. Honest. 


## General Format 

When writing these journal entries, we need to answer Cameron's questions three. 

1) What challenges you had, and how you overcame them

2) If you weren't challenged, what you did to push yourself

3) What did you do outside of class


## Day 01 - October 23, 2018 

1) What challenges / How did you overcome? 

- One challenge I am having is I do not know how to get started with phpUnit, nor do I understand virtual hosts. 

2) How did you push yourself? 

- Completed all exercises in class that I could manage, just short of PHP Objects 
- Looked into setting up a development environment on Linux
- Set up LAMP stack as components, but still do not understand Virtual Hosts... Checked Online and Text for Documentation
    - Pursued online resource (Udemy) for setting up PHP development environment with Virtual Hosts.... 
    - Called it quits around 10:30/11:00pm. 

3) What did you do outside of class?  

- See above 
    - Udemy, Textbook Work, Surfing internet for docs on setting up a Virtual Host... To no avail. 


## Day 02 - October 24, 2018 

1) What Challenges / Overcome 

- Recalling algorithm design / helping others with the basics of algorithm design (pseudocode) 
- Setting up Laravel/PHP Unit didn't go well at home last night... composer ran into permission issues 
    - Tested at school computer, and worked fine, though. 
- Focussed on setting up Virtual Hosts with some success at home, though - but now we run into the problem that 
    modern browsers depend on having SSH certificates (Chrome will block non-localhost VH's) 
    - So I know it's there, and I can access it with Elinks, but not with any graphical browsers 
    - Efforts and tinkering ended up breaking my LAMP stack... apt-get purges were also unsuccessful... apache2 remained 
        present even though I theoretically apt-get purge'd it off the face of the earth?!?!?! Doesn't parse PHP tho, so 
        obviously something happened. 
    - Ran a vicious apt-get purge on all components of AMP I installed, and installed XAMPP to get my projects limping for now 
        - Seems to work, but feel bad for not understanding how to get the AMP stack functional on its own 

2) How did you Push 

- Completed the FIZZBUZZ challenge in class. Very fun. 
- Installed Laravel / phpUnit on Windows machine at school (home machine to be tomorrow) 
- See (1) for unsuccessful attempts at getting Virtual Hosts running at home 
    - Will consult with Cameron tomorrow about SSH Certificates, then proceed to try tomorrow
- Tapped out at 10:37pm 

3) What did you do outside of class 

- See (1) & (2), but a lot of unsuccessful attempts at getting Virtual Hosts to work on my Linux Box at home 
    - Messing around thoroughly with the guts of the modern AMP stack (and ultimately breaking it... twice)
    - Acknowledging that I'm not much of a System Administrator.... Looking into ways to increase that knowledge base
        - Note: Even failed experimentation is upping that knowledge base, Alex!!!
